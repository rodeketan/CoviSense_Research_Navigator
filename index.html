COVID-19 is&lt;br&gt;caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome&lt;br&gt;coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and highlights an urgent need&lt;br&gt;for therapeutics. Here, we have employed a series&lt;br&gt;of computer-aided drug repurposing campaign to&lt;br&gt;discover inhibitors of RNA dependent RNA polymerase&lt;br&gt;(RdRp) and Nsp15/EndoU. Subsequently, MD simulation&lt;br&gt;has been performed to observe dynamic behavior of&lt;br&gt;identified leads at the active site of RdRp and Nsp15. We&lt;br&gt;successfully identified novel lead molecule such as&lt;br&gt;Alectinib for RdRp while Naldemedine and Ergotamine for&lt;br&gt;NSP15. These lead molecules were accommodated in the&lt;br&gt;active site of..."," African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious&lt;br&gt;disease with high mortality in domestic and feral swine&lt;br&gt;populations. Although it is not a zoonosis, its spread may&lt;br&gt;have severe socioeconomic and public health&lt;br&gt;consequences. The activities of veterinary services are&lt;br&gt;essential for controlling ASF outbreaks within a&lt;br&gt;country, but also for diminishing its threat of spread to&lt;br&gt;neighbouring countries, and for recognizing its entry into&lt;br&gt;countries that are currently free. ASF requires quick&lt;br&gt;responses and permanent monitoring to identify&lt;br&gt;outbreaks and prevent spread, and both aspects can be&lt;br&gt;heavily undercut during the COVID-19 pandemic. This&lt;br&gt;paper analyses changing patterns of the..."," The entry of the SARS coronavirus (SCV) into&lt;br&gt;cells is initiated by binding of its spike envelope&lt;br&gt;glycoprotein (S) to a receptor, ACE2. We and others&lt;br&gt;identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by using S&lt;br&gt;fragments of various lengths but all including the amino&lt;br&gt;acid residue 318 and two other potential&lt;br&gt;glycosylation sites. To further characterize the role of&lt;br&gt;glycosylation and identify residues important for its&lt;br&gt;function as an interacting partner of ACE2, we have&lt;br&gt;cloned, expressed and characterized various soluble&lt;br&gt;fragments of S containing RBD, and mutated all potential&lt;br&gt;glycosylation sites and 32 other residues. The shortest of&lt;br&gt;these fragments..."," Given that ebolavirus causes severe and&lt;br&gt;frequently lethal disease, its rapid and accurate&lt;br&gt;detection using available and validated methods is&lt;br&gt;essential for controlling infection. Real-time&lt;br&gt;reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) has proven to be an invaluable tool&lt;br&gt;for ebolaviruses diagnostics. Many assays with&lt;br&gt;different targets have been developed, but they have not&lt;br&gt;been externally compared or validated, and limits&lt;br&gt;of detection are not uniformly reported. Here we&lt;br&gt;compared and evaluated the sensitivity,&lt;br&gt;reproducibility and specificity of 23 in-house assays under the&lt;br&gt;same conditions.

However, some animal populations are reported&lt;br&gt;to inbreed without incurring inbreeding&lt;br&gt;depression, ostensibly due to past \"purging\" of&lt;br&gt;deleterious alleles. Challenging this is the position that&lt;br&gt;purging can, at best, only adapt a population to a&lt;br&gt;particular environment; novel selective regimes will&lt;br&gt;always uncover additional inbreeding load. We&lt;br&gt;consider this in a prominent test case: the eusocial&lt;br&gt;naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), one of the&lt;br&gt;most inbred of all free-living mammals.

In this&lt;br&gt;questionnaire study, we aimed to analyze potential barriers&lt;br&gt;and patients' health beliefs during and after the&lt;br&gt;lockdown early 2020 in a tertiary referral center in&lt;br&gt;Kiel, Germany."," Flaviviruses bud into the endoplasmic&lt;br&gt;reticulum and are transported through the secretory&lt;br&gt;pathway, where the mildly acidic environment triggers&lt;br&gt;particle rearrangement and allows furin processing of&lt;br&gt;the prM protein to pr and M. The peripheral pr&lt;br&gt;peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits&lt;br&gt;virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of&lt;br&gt;pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an&lt;br&gt;infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests&lt;br&gt;that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E&lt;br&gt;from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway.&lt;br&gt;Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute&lt;br&gt;the interaction of dengue virus..."," Summary 47 SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented&lt;br&gt;worldwide health problem that requires concerted and 48&lt;br&gt;global approaches to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;br&gt;Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets 49 lung&lt;br&gt;epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the&lt;br&gt;intestinal epithelium is also 50 infected.

Such a&lt;br&gt;notion acknowledges humanity's reliance on&lt;br&gt;technologies to transmute history, trauma, or memory,&lt;br&gt;transforming technologies from medium and machine into&lt;br&gt;artefacts for circulation and exchange. The&lt;br&gt;transcendence of medium into artefacts as sites of trauma&lt;br&gt;equally highlights the sociopolitical frames within&lt;br&gt;which testimony is extracted and witnessing is&lt;br&gt;enacted, unleashing trauma as a cultural form and a&lt;br&gt;resonant genre of popular consumption.

I argue that posts often express experiences,&lt;br&gt;thoughts, and fantasies in a schematic manner. They&lt;br&gt;reproduce a paranoid-schizoid logic by which particular&lt;br&gt;views on the current crisis are articulated and&lt;br&gt;different ones are negated. The Kleinian framework is&lt;br&gt;supplemented with Lacan's notion of the Discourse of the&lt;br&gt;Hysteric.

From&lt;br&gt;dermato-epidemiological studies conducted on psoriatic and other&lt;br&gt;rheumatological patients, IL-17 inhibitors seem to attenuate&lt;br&gt;or even prevent the cytokine storm and thus ICU&lt;br&gt;referral. Furthermore, both invivo and in-vitro&lt;br&gt;experiments suggest that IL-17 plays a key role in&lt;br&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection progression. Due to this evidence,&lt;br&gt;we decided to summarize the literature findings&lt;br&gt;on IL-17 inhibitors and COVID-19, maintaining&lt;br&gt;psoriasis as the referral disease to better understand&lt;br&gt;the extent of drug effects on the immune system."," Melioidosis, endemic in Southeast Asia and&lt;br&gt;Northern Australia, is an uncommon but frequently fatal&lt;br&gt;opportunistic infection caused by the Gram-negative&lt;br&gt;saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei.

Macrophages have been&lt;br&gt;associated with numerous beneficial roles, such as host&lt;br&gt;defense, wound healing, and tissue regeneration;&lt;br&gt;however, they have also been linked to the development of&lt;br&gt;diverse illnesses, particularly cancers and&lt;br&gt;autoimmune disorders. Complex signaling, epigenetic,&lt;br&gt;and metabolic pathways drive macrophage training&lt;br&gt;and tolerance. The induced intracellular program&lt;br&gt;differs depending on the type of initial stimuli and the&lt;br&gt;tissue microenvironment.

If a government can effectively&lt;br&gt;accumulate big data from various sources and use&lt;br&gt;appropriate analytical methods, it may quickly respond to&lt;br&gt;achieve optimal public health decisions, thereby&lt;br&gt;ameliorating negative impacts from a public health incident&lt;br&gt;and more quickly restoring normality. Although&lt;br&gt;there are many reports and studies examining how to&lt;br&gt;use big data for epidemic prevention, there is&lt;br&gt;still a lack of an effective review and framework"," The home quarantine in the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;br&gt;has created challenges for teaching across the&lt;br&gt;world and called for innovative teaching, as well as&lt;br&gt;teachers' learning. Given the rapid development of&lt;br&gt;teachers' online learning and teaching, identifying&lt;br&gt;effective ways to facilitate innovative teaching under&lt;br&gt;such challenging conditions is a critical issue.&lt;br&gt;Although researchers have realized that workplace&lt;br&gt;informal learning (IL) increasingly reveals its&lt;br&gt;potential value to individual development, the&lt;br&gt;relationship between IL and innovation has been&lt;br&gt;under-explored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the&lt;br&gt;impact of IL on innovative teaching, through the&lt;br&gt;mediating roles of three types of teaching-related..."," Human-generated droplets constitute the main&lt;br&gt;route for the transmission of coronavirus. However,&lt;br&gt;the details of such transmission in enclosed&lt;br&gt;environments are yet to be understood. This is because&lt;br&gt;geometrical and environmental parameters can immensely&lt;br&gt;complicate the problem and turn the conventional analyses&lt;br&gt;inefficient. As a remedy, this work develops a predictive&lt;br&gt;tool based on computational fluid dynamics and&lt;br&gt;machine learning to examine the distribution of&lt;br&gt;sneezing droplets in realistic configurations. The&lt;br&gt;time-dependent effects of environmental parameters, 2&lt;br&gt;including temperature, humidity and ventilation rate,&lt;br&gt;upon the droplets with diameters between 1 and 250&lt;br&gt;are investigated inside a bus.

Such&lt;br&gt;unpredictability and heightened dynamism require rapid&lt;br&gt;responses, mainly prompted by the realization that such&lt;br&gt;irregular phenomena cannot be dealt with using&lt;br&gt;conventionally structured and organized approaches alone. In&lt;br&gt;line with this ongoing conversation fuelled&lt;br&gt;notably by the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated&lt;br&gt;digital acceleration, in this paper, we lay out the case&lt;br&gt;for how \"actively embracing disorganization\" as a&lt;br&gt;new work form can be a mechanism that facilitates&lt;br&gt;the creation and enactment of important dynamic&lt;br&gt;capabilities thus enhancing a firm's ability to cope with&lt;br&gt;unpredictable environments.

It is motivated by the desire to reduce&lt;br&gt;passengers' likelihood of passing close to seated&lt;br&gt;passengers when they take their seats. However, our prior&lt;br&gt;work on the risk of Ebola spread in aeroplanes&lt;br&gt;suggested that the driving force for increased exposure&lt;br&gt;to infection transmission risk is the clustering&lt;br&gt;of passengers while waiting for others to stow&lt;br&gt;their luggage and take their seats. In this work, we&lt;br&gt;examine whether the new boarding processes lead to..."," Because the effects of drug abuse on the&lt;br&gt;cellular elements of the human brain have not been&lt;br&gt;studied systematically, an investigation was&lt;br&gt;performed using histology, immunohistochemistry, and&lt;br&gt;morphometry. The main cortical and subcortical brain areas&lt;br&gt;of 50 polydrug deaths were analyzed as compared&lt;br&gt;with controls.\nIn the brains of drug abusers, a&lt;br&gt;significant neuronal loss was present. Interestingly, the&lt;br&gt;number of glial fibrillary acidic protein&lt;br&gt;(GFAP)-positive astrocytes was reduced. The numerical density&lt;br&gt;of perivascular and parenchymal microglia was&lt;br&gt;increased in the white matter and in most subcortical&lt;br&gt;regions.

Comments and&lt;br&gt;questions were also entertained from the members of the&lt;br&gt;audience.\nQuestion 1: Considering the potential advantages of&lt;br&gt;microbial decontamination of indoor air, what criteria&lt;br&gt;should be used to select a given technology? Dr C.&lt;br&gt;Duchaine: Technologies of interest will depend on the&lt;br&gt;situation and the point source of microbial&lt;br&gt;contamination, for example, a person coughing in an emergency&lt;br&gt;room, a patient vomiting in a hospital ward, or a&lt;br&gt;student vomiting in a classroom. The intervention of&lt;br&gt;choice..."," Interval prediction often provides more&lt;br&gt;useful information compared to a simple point&lt;br&gt;forecast. For example, in renewable energy forecasting,&lt;br&gt;while the initial focus has been on deterministic&lt;br&gt;predictions, the uncertainty observed in energy generation&lt;br&gt;raises an interest in producing probabilistic&lt;br&gt;forecasts. One aims to provide prediction intervals so&lt;br&gt;that outcomes lie in the interval with a given&lt;br&gt;probability. Therefore, the problem of estimating the&lt;br&gt;quantiles of a variable arises. The contribution of our&lt;br&gt;paper is two-fold. First, we propose to apply the&lt;br&gt;framework of prediction with expert advice for the&lt;br&gt;prediction of quantiles. Second, we propose a new&lt;br&gt;competitive online..."," Motorcycles dominate current transport&lt;br&gt;activities in Vietnamese cities; however, historical&lt;br&gt;data show that bikes and public transport were&lt;br&gt;popular as recently as 30 years ago. Because the&lt;br&gt;transport infrastructure in Vietnamese cities makes it&lt;br&gt;unsafe for cycling and inconvenient for public&lt;br&gt;transport, many cyclists and public transport users&lt;br&gt;switch to private motorized vehicles, particularly&lt;br&gt;motorcycles, as soon as they can afford to make the change. The&lt;br&gt;preference for motorcycles in Vietnamese cities has&lt;br&gt;resulted in an increased risk of road traffic accidents&lt;br&gt;and a degradation of air quality. Reducing the&lt;br&gt;share of motorcycles on Vietnamese roads by&lt;br&gt;improving public transport..."," Emergency endoscopy in coronavirus disease&lt;br&gt;2019 (COVID-19) patients should be avoided&lt;br&gt;whenever possible to ensure the safety of medical staff;&lt;br&gt;however, it may be unavoidable in some cases.

Mask mandate&lt;br&gt;introduction was staggered from mid-June to mid-August 2020&lt;br&gt;in the 34 public health regions in Ontario,&lt;br&gt;Canada's largest province by population. Using this&lt;br&gt;variation, we find that mask mandates are associated with a&lt;br&gt;22 percent weekly reduction in new COVID-19&lt;br&gt;cases, relative to the trend in absence of mandate.&lt;br&gt;Province-level data provide corroborating evidence. We&lt;br&gt;control for mobility behaviour using Google&lt;br&gt;geo-location data and for lagged case totals and case growth&lt;br&gt;as information variables.

Conditions used for cell isolation and&lt;br&gt;expansion should meet strict quality and safety&lt;br&gt;requirements. This is particularly true for the growth medium&lt;br&gt;used for MSC isolation and expansion. Basal growth&lt;br&gt;media used for MSC expansion are supplemented with&lt;br&gt;multiple nutrients and growth factors. Fetal bovine&lt;br&gt;serum (FBS) has long been the gold standard medium&lt;br&gt;supplement for laboratory-scale MSC..."," We found tha: rats subjected to thermal skin&lt;br&gt;injury (bum) had increased serum hydrogen peroxide&lt;br&gt;(H202) scavenging activity, serum catalase&lt;br&gt;activity, erythrocyte (RBC) fragility, and edematous&lt;br&gt;lung injury (lung leak) when compared to&lt;br&gt;sham-treated rats. Serum H202 scavenging activity was&lt;br&gt;inhibited by addition of sodium azide, a catalase&lt;br&gt;inhibitor. Treatment of rats with the oxygen radical&lt;br&gt;scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), decreased RBC&lt;br&gt;fragility and lung leak but did not alter increased H2Oz&lt;br&gt;scavenging or catalase activity of serum from rats&lt;br&gt;subjected to skin bum. We conclude that increased serum&lt;br&gt;catalase activity is a consequence of thermal skin&lt;br&gt;injury and that increased..."," Objective: To evaluate how the SARS-COV2 is&lt;br&gt;able to affect the nervous system, the main&lt;br&gt;neurological manifestation, and the treatment used,&lt;br&gt;including neurorehabilitation.

We sought to expand the&lt;br&gt;existing literature on intention to leave one's child&lt;br&gt;welfare agency and commitment to child welfare work&lt;br&gt;through examining the coping mechanisms of frontline&lt;br&gt;workers. Having and utilizing healthy coping&lt;br&gt;mechanisms has proved beneficial to child welfare workers&lt;br&gt;in previous research. In this paper, we examine&lt;br&gt;specific coping mechanisms identified in the&lt;br&gt;Comprehensive Organizational Health Assessment and how they&lt;br&gt;were associated with child welfare workers' intent&lt;br&gt;to leave their agency and their commitment to&lt;br&gt;remain in the field..."," a b s t r a c t REST[ES] is the first Canadian human&lt;br&gt;taphonomic facility (HTF) dedicated to research and&lt;br&gt;training relating to human decomposition in a northern&lt;br&gt;temperate climate.

Several recent studies suggested presence of&lt;br&gt;clinical phenotypes in patients with sepsis and&lt;br&gt;heterogenous treatment effects across different sepsis&lt;br&gt;phenotypes. We examined the latent phenotypes of sepsis&lt;br&gt;with coagulopathy and the associations between&lt;br&gt;thrombomodulin treatment and the 28-day and in-hospital&lt;br&gt;mortality for each phenotype.\nMethods: This was a&lt;br&gt;secondary analysis of multicentre registries&lt;br&gt;containing data on patients (aged \u2265 16 years) who were&lt;br&gt;admitted to intensive care units for severe sepsis or&lt;br&gt;septic shock in Japan. Three multicentre registries&lt;br&gt;were..."," Nurses form the pillar of India's healthcare&lt;br&gt;system representing 30.5% of the entire health&lt;br&gt;workforce in India. Amidst a significant shortage in the&lt;br&gt;provision of effective primary care, jeopardizing&lt;br&gt;millions of Indians' access to basic healthcare&lt;br&gt;services, especially the poorest, it is very evident that&lt;br&gt;nurse practitioners are the need of the hour in India.&lt;br&gt;The current scenario of nursing in India warrants&lt;br&gt;policy reforms to facilitate nurses as valuable&lt;br&gt;primary care providers. It also shows the path towards&lt;br&gt;making the Health and Wellness Centre operational by&lt;br&gt;creating a pivotal role for the cadre in such centres, and&lt;br&gt;it will..."," Background: The coronavirus disease 2019&lt;br&gt;(COVID-19) pandemic has engendered difficulties for&lt;br&gt;health systems globally; however, the effect of the&lt;br&gt;pandemic on emergency medicine (EM) residency training&lt;br&gt;programs is unknown. The pandemic has caused reduced&lt;br&gt;volumes of emergency department (ED) patients, except&lt;br&gt;for those with COVID-19 infections, and this may&lt;br&gt;reduce the case exposure of EM residents. The primary&lt;br&gt;objective of this study was to compare the clinical&lt;br&gt;exposure of EM residents between the prepandemic and&lt;br&gt;pandemic periods. Methods: This was a retrospective&lt;br&gt;study of EM resident physicians' training in a&lt;br&gt;tertiary teaching hospital with two branch regional&lt;br&gt;hospitals in Taiwan...."," Nitric oxide (NO) represents a key signaling&lt;br&gt;molecule in multiple regulatory pathways underlying&lt;br&gt;vascular, metabolic, immune, and neurological function&lt;br&gt;across animal phyla. Our brief critical discussion is&lt;br&gt;focused on the multiple roles of the NO signaling&lt;br&gt;pathways in the maintenance of basal physiological&lt;br&gt;states of readiness in diverse cell types mediating&lt;br&gt;innate immunological functions and in the&lt;br&gt;facilitation of proinflammatory-mediated adaptive&lt;br&gt;immunological responses associated with viral infections.&lt;br&gt;Prior studies have reinforced the critical&lt;br&gt;importance of constitutive NO signaling pathways in the&lt;br&gt;homeostatic maintenance of the vascular endothelium, and&lt;br&gt;state-dependent changes in innate immunological responses&lt;br&gt;have been associated with a functional..."," We had earlier proposed a hypothesis to explain&lt;br&gt;the mechanism of perpetuation of immunological&lt;br&gt;memory based on the operation of idiotypic network in&lt;br&gt;the complete absence of antigen. Experimental&lt;br&gt;evidences were provided for memory maintenance through&lt;br&gt;anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab 2 ) carrying the internal image of&lt;br&gt;the antigen. In the present work, we describe a&lt;br&gt;structural basis for such memory perpetuation by&lt;br&gt;molecular modeling and structural analysis studies. A&lt;br&gt;three-dimensional model of Ab 2 was generated and the structure of&lt;br&gt;the antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein H&lt;br&gt;of Rinderpest virus was modeled using the&lt;br&gt;structural template of hemagglutinin protein..."," Background and purpose Virus-containing&lt;br&gt;aerosol droplets emitted by breathing, speech or&lt;br&gt;coughing dry rapidly to equilibrium with ambient&lt;br&gt;relative humidity (RH), increasing in solute&lt;br&gt;concentration with effects on virus survival and decreasing&lt;br&gt;in diameter with effects on sedimentation and&lt;br&gt;respiratory uptake. The aim of this paper is to model the&lt;br&gt;effect of ionic and macromolecular solutes on droplet&lt;br&gt;drying and solute concentration. Methods&lt;br&gt;Deliquescence-efflorescence concepts and Kohler theory were used to&lt;br&gt;simulate the evolution of solute concentrations and&lt;br&gt;water activity in respiratory droplets, starting&lt;br&gt;from efflorescence data on mixed NaCl/KCl aerosols&lt;br&gt;and osmotic pressure data on respiratory&lt;br&gt;macromolecules.

However, the&lt;br&gt;positive psychological processes that help to promote&lt;br&gt;CSE in foreign-language learning (FLL) remain&lt;br&gt;under-studied. Focusing specifically on FLL students, the&lt;br&gt;present study examined the associations among&lt;br&gt;optimism, hope, empathy, and CSE and investigated the&lt;br&gt;possible mediating roles of hope and empathy in the&lt;br&gt;relationship between optimism and CSE. A sample of 330 FLL&lt;br&gt;students from two Chinese universities participated in&lt;br&gt;this study.

The emergence of&lt;br&gt;methicillin-resistant (MRSA), as well as vancomycin-resistant&lt;br&gt;(VRSA) strains of S. aureus, poses a massive threat to&lt;br&gt;human health. The tenacity of S. aureus to acquire&lt;br&gt;resistance against numerous antibiotics in a very short&lt;br&gt;duration makes the effort towards developing new&lt;br&gt;antibiotics almost futile. S. aureus owes its destructive&lt;br&gt;pathogenicity to the plethora of virulent factors it produces&lt;br&gt;among which a majority of them are moonlighting&lt;br&gt;proteins.

Health system leaders cannot allow&lt;br&gt;other priorities to interfere with a commitment to&lt;br&gt;address health inequities. Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;Medical Center (VUMC) has embedded strategies to&lt;br&gt;mitigate health inequities in its Covid-19 Command&lt;br&gt;Center. A key strategy is the creation of interactive&lt;br&gt;dashboards, which are reviewed daily and allow&lt;br&gt;disaggregation by race, ethnicity, language, and ZIP Code.

The PEDV is one of the major concerns&lt;br&gt;of the pig industry around the world, including&lt;br&gt;Asian countries and Noth America since first&lt;br&gt;identified in Europe. Currently, there is no PEDV licensed&lt;br&gt;vaccine to effectively prevent this disease. This&lt;br&gt;study was performed for the development of a mucosal&lt;br&gt;PEDV vaccine and B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) as a&lt;br&gt;carrier was employed to surpass the tolerogenic nature&lt;br&gt;of GALT and induce potent immune..."," Under the outbreak of COVID-19, it was urgent to&lt;br&gt;analyze the cases from clinical features and&lt;br&gt;epidemiological factors, as well as understand the&lt;br&gt;effectiveness of measures taken on disease prevent and&lt;br&gt;control. A retrospective study was applied for&lt;br&gt;descriptive analysis of clinical features and&lt;br&gt;epidemiological factors of confirmed cases in four cities of&lt;br&gt;Zhejiang.

In this article we&lt;br&gt;develop an understanding of chronic&lt;br&gt;psychophysiological stress from a psychological educational&lt;br&gt;perspective, by drawing on supporting evidence that&lt;br&gt;significant emotional events in early life (traumatic and&lt;br&gt;benign) can influence health and well-being later in&lt;br&gt;life. We suggest that traumatic events instigate&lt;br&gt;psychophysiological \"stress\" responses and the formation of&lt;br&gt;emotional memory images (EMIs) within very short time&lt;br&gt;frames, i.e., \"split-second learning.\" Once formed&lt;br&gt;these emotional memories are triggered in daily&lt;br&gt;living \"re-playing\" psychophysiological stress&lt;br&gt;responses, resulting in chronic..."," People with chronic diseases represent a&lt;br&gt;population at major risk of infection and complications&lt;br&gt;from Sars-Cov-2 (COVID-19). Diabetes represents&lt;br&gt;one of the most important comorbidities related to&lt;br&gt;the severity of viral infection caused by the new&lt;br&gt;Sars-Cov-2. Diabetes patients have a higher risk of serious&lt;br&gt;complications caused by Sars-Cov-2 infection, such as severe&lt;br&gt;acute respiratory syndrome, a hyperinflammatory&lt;br&gt;state associated with multi-organ dysfunction.&lt;br&gt;Given the importance of the link between COVID-19 and&lt;br&gt;diabetes, it is essential to better manage glycemic&lt;br&gt;normalization and infection in this category of patients to&lt;br&gt;avoid serious complications. However, for some&lt;br&gt;antidiabetes agents, there is evidence..."," While cultivation is a convenient way of&lt;br&gt;proliferating and understanding bacteria, studies have&lt;br&gt;shown the formation of nonculturable cells in&lt;br&gt;nonspore-forming bacteria in response to environmental stress&lt;br&gt;and thus in turn have generated immense interest.&lt;br&gt;Whether these cells are in a state of dormancy or in a&lt;br&gt;stage preceding cell death has been considered of&lt;br&gt;paramount importance for the past couple of decades. In&lt;br&gt;this study, osmotic-stress-induced dormant&lt;br&gt;bacterial cells were separated by cell sorting and&lt;br&gt;revived by osmotic down-shift in the absence of&lt;br&gt;nutrients, source(s) that potentially could supply&lt;br&gt;nutrients, and/or the external addition of resuscitation&lt;br&gt;factor(s).

Since increased levels of D-dimer (DD) are&lt;br&gt;associated with coagulopathy in COVID-19, we explored&lt;br&gt;whether DD contributes to the aberrant cytokine&lt;br&gt;responses. Here we show that treatment of healthy human&lt;br&gt;monocytes with DD induced a dose dependent increase in&lt;br&gt;production of pyrogenic mediator, Prostaglandin E2&lt;br&gt;(PGE2) and inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8. The&lt;br&gt;DD-induced PGE2 and inflammatory cytokines were enhanced&lt;br&gt;significantly by co-treatment with immune complexes (IC) of&lt;br&gt;SARS CoV-2 recombinant S protein or of pseudovirus&lt;br&gt;containing SARS CoV-2 S protein (PVCoV-2) coated with&lt;br&gt;spike-specific..."," Citation: Scarcella, M.; Scarpellini, E.;&lt;br&gt;Ascani, A.; Commissari, R.; Scorcella, C.; Zanetti,&lt;br&gt;M.; Parisi, A.; Monti, R.; Milic, N.; Donati, A.; et&lt;br&gt;al.

The supercomplex&lt;br&gt;is a unique hollow, cylinder-like structure&lt;br&gt;assembled from eight copies of nsp8 and held tightly&lt;br&gt;together by eight copies of nsp7. With an internal&lt;br&gt;diameter of B30 \u00c5 , the central channel has dimensions and&lt;br&gt;positive electrostatic properties favorable for&lt;br&gt;nucleic acid binding, implying that its role is to&lt;br&gt;confer processivity on RNA-dependent RNA&lt;br&gt;polymerase."," We recently reported that anti-CD13 mAbs&lt;br&gt;induce homotypic aggregation of monocytic cells.&lt;br&gt;This phenomenon is signal transduction dependent&lt;br&gt;and does not require CD13 aminopeptidase&lt;br&gt;activity. Since CD13 is heavily glycosylated and a member&lt;br&gt;of the galectin family (galectin-4) has been&lt;br&gt;shown to associate with CD13 in the intestinal&lt;br&gt;epithelium, we hypothesized that CD13-mediated&lt;br&gt;aggregation might proceed through a&lt;br&gt;carbohydrate-dependent mechanism involving galectin-3, the most&lt;br&gt;highly expressed galectin on monocytes. We report&lt;br&gt;here that lactose and anti-galectin-3 antibodies&lt;br&gt;completely abrogate homotypic aggregation induced by&lt;br&gt;anti-CD13 antibodies.

Prolonged use of endotracheal with inflated&lt;br&gt;cuff is one of the major multifactorial causes of&lt;br&gt;complications. Both under-inflation and over-inflation of&lt;br&gt;cuff are associated with complications. Despite&lt;br&gt;known problems, regular measurement of cuff&lt;br&gt;pressure is not routine, and it is performed on an ad hoc&lt;br&gt;basis."," Mucositis is an inevitable side-effect of the&lt;br&gt;conditioning regimens used for haematopoietic stem cell&lt;br&gt;transplantation. The condition is better referred to as mucosal&lt;br&gt;barrier injury (MBI) since it is primarily the result of&lt;br&gt;toxicity and is a complex and dynamic pathobiological&lt;br&gt;process manifested not only in the mouth but also&lt;br&gt;throughout the entire digestive tract.

Secondly, a coatingsubstrate&lt;br&gt;planner model was used to simulate the interdiffusion&lt;br&gt;of elements between the MCrAlY coating and..."," Tracing explanatory narratives of&lt;br&gt;mask-wearing throughout COVID-19, we argue that multiple&lt;br&gt;narratives contribute to the global experience of&lt;br&gt;COVID-19, making it as much a social and political object&lt;br&gt;as it is a scientific one. This assumption drives&lt;br&gt;our commitment to take seriously alternative&lt;br&gt;narratives that do not conform to dominant ones in order to&lt;br&gt;examine how structures of power might privilege&lt;br&gt;particular types of 'truths' and with what consequences.&lt;br&gt;We see this reflective piece as a re-articulation&lt;br&gt;of social work's historic call to interrogate&lt;br&gt;dominant ways of knowing, particularly the ways in which&lt;br&gt;science obscures its own power and politics..."," The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of&lt;br&gt;consumers in virtually every nation. Based upon the&lt;br&gt;theory of psychological reactance and&lt;br&gt;psychoevolutionary theory of emotion, we hypothesize how such&lt;br&gt;lifestyle changes affect consumers perceiving and&lt;br&gt;responding to companies' communications messages. The&lt;br&gt;theories also suggest that consumers in different&lt;br&gt;cultures may respond to COVID-19 differently. To test&lt;br&gt;our hypotheses, we implemented a Python scraper to&lt;br&gt;collect companies' Instagram posts pre-and during the&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 lockdown.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is&lt;br&gt;a major threat to 20 pediatric patients and the&lt;br&gt;elderly. We describe 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU,&lt;br&gt;EIDD-2749), a ribonucleoside analog that inhibits RSV,&lt;br&gt;related RNA viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 with high&lt;br&gt;selectivity index in cells and well-differentiated human&lt;br&gt;airway epithelia. Polymerase inhibition in in vitro&lt;br&gt;RdRP assays established for RSV and SARS-CoV-2&lt;br&gt;revealed transcriptional pauses at positions i or i+3/4&lt;br&gt;post-incorporation.

For instance, increased infectivity&lt;br&gt;of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 arose in&lt;br&gt;part through rapid evolution along the interface&lt;br&gt;between the Spike protein and its human receptor ACE2,&lt;br&gt;leading to increased binding affinity. To facilitate&lt;br&gt;broader exploration of how pathogen-host&lt;br&gt;interactions might impact transmission and virulence in the&lt;br&gt;ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we performed&lt;br&gt;state-of-the-art interface prediction followed by molecular&lt;br&gt;docking to construct a 3D structural interactome&lt;br&gt;between SARS-CoV-2 and human. We additionally carried&lt;br&gt;out downstream meta-analyses to investigate&lt;br&gt;enrichment of sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-1..."," 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylethanol (DOPET) is a&lt;br&gt;polyphenol found in olive oil. The present study evaluated&lt;br&gt;the protective role of DOPET on LPS provoked septic&lt;br&gt;cardiac injury in a murine model. Four groups were used&lt;br&gt;in the study (n = 3): control, LPS, DOPET alone, and&lt;br&gt;DOPET + LPS. LPS (15 mg/kg; i.p.); they were used to&lt;br&gt;induce cardiac sepsis. The cardiac markers like LDH,&lt;br&gt;CK-MB, and troponin-T, as well as inflammatory&lt;br&gt;cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were measured in the serum.&lt;br&gt;The antioxidants and oxidative stress parameters&lt;br&gt;were measured in cardiac tissues.

For clinicians to effectively counsel&lt;br&gt;patients on self-weighing, they should be aware of the&lt;br&gt;costs and features available in typical home scales.&lt;br&gt;Our objective was to describe the cost and features&lt;br&gt;of the top bathroom scales available online. We&lt;br&gt;performed content analysis of top 100 scales listed on a&lt;br&gt;popular online retailer. Two coders independently&lt;br&gt;extracted price and scale features (i.e., digital&lt;br&gt;connectivity, body mass index [BMI] calculation, maximum&lt;br&gt;weight accommodated).

This case&lt;br&gt;report will discuss the diagnostic approach in a&lt;br&gt;female child, three years old, with neurologic&lt;br&gt;deficits. The diagnostic approach of ANEC consists of&lt;br&gt;clinical manifestation, laboratory examination,&lt;br&gt;cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and neuroimaging&lt;br&gt;interpretation. The patient had high liver enzyme, normal CSF&lt;br&gt;analysis with appearances of edema, hemorrhage and&lt;br&gt;necrosis in serial brain magnetic resonance imaging&lt;br&gt;(MRI)."," The MixColumns operation is an important&lt;br&gt;component providing diffusion for the AES. The branch&lt;br&gt;number of it ensures that any continuous four rounds of&lt;br&gt;the AES have at least 25 active S-Boxes, which makes&lt;br&gt;the AES secure against the differential and linear&lt;br&gt;cryptanalysis. However, the choices of the coefficients of the&lt;br&gt;MixColumns matrix may undermine the AES security against&lt;br&gt;some novel-type attacks. A particular property of&lt;br&gt;the AES MixColumns matrix coefficient has been&lt;br&gt;noticed in recent papers that each row or column of the&lt;br&gt;matrix has elements that sum to zero. Several attacks&lt;br&gt;have been developed taking advantage of the..."," Introduction: To better define COVID-19&lt;br&gt;longterm impact we prospectively analysed&lt;br&gt;patientcentred outcomes, including general health and&lt;br&gt;symptom duration. Methods: Barthel index (BI), St.&lt;br&gt;George's Respiratory Questionnaire adapted to&lt;br&gt;patients with COVID-19 (aSGRQ) and WHO Clinical&lt;br&gt;Progression Scale (CPS) were measured at enrolment and at 6&lt;br&gt;weeks from the onset of symptoms. Persistence of most&lt;br&gt;frequently reported symptoms was assessed at 6 weeks and,&lt;br&gt;among symptomatic patients, at 12 weeks from the&lt;br&gt;onset of symptoms. Predictors of impaired general&lt;br&gt;health over time were identified using an ordinal&lt;br&gt;multilevel multivariate model.

However, noise and batch&lt;br&gt;effect in sparse single-cell expression profiles can&lt;br&gt;hamper correct estimation of dependencies among&lt;br&gt;genes and regulatory changes. Here, we devise a&lt;br&gt;conceptually different method using graphwavelet filters&lt;br&gt;for improving gene network (GWNet)-based&lt;br&gt;analysis of the transcriptome. Our approach improved&lt;br&gt;the performance of several gene&lt;br&gt;network-inference methods. Most Importantly, GWNet improved&lt;br&gt;consistency in the prediction of gene regulatory network&lt;br&gt;using single-cell transcriptome even in the&lt;br&gt;presence of batch effect.

To explore whether&lt;br&gt;hypertension serves as a risk factor for disease severity, a&lt;br&gt;multi-centre, retrospective study was conducted in COVID-19&lt;br&gt;patients. A total of 498 consecutively hospitalised&lt;br&gt;patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 in China were&lt;br&gt;enrolled in this cohort. Using logistic regression, we&lt;br&gt;assessed the association between hypertension and the&lt;br&gt;likelihood of severe illness with adjustment for&lt;br&gt;confounders.

To disentangle the forces that&lt;br&gt;generated this outcome, we construct a model that is&lt;br&gt;consistent with the heterogeneous impact of the COVID&lt;br&gt;recession on low-and high-income people. According to&lt;br&gt;our model, twothirds of the inequality in COVID&lt;br&gt;deaths reflect preexisting inequality in&lt;br&gt;comorbidity rates and access to quality health care. The&lt;br&gt;remaining third stems from the fact that low-income&lt;br&gt;people work in occupations where the risk of infection&lt;br&gt;is high. Our model also implies that the rise in&lt;br&gt;income inequality generated by the COVID..."," This chapter describes the steps needed to&lt;br&gt;formulate, analyze and apply epidemiological models to&lt;br&gt;vector-borne diseases. Our models focus on West Nile (WN)&lt;br&gt;virus, an emerging infectious disease in North&lt;br&gt;America, first identified in Africa. We begin by&lt;br&gt;introducing a minimalist model for WN dynamics to&lt;br&gt;illustrate the processes of model formulation, analysis,&lt;br&gt;and application. We then revisit the question of&lt;br&gt;model formulation to examine how two major&lt;br&gt;biological assumptions affect the model structure and&lt;br&gt;therefore its predictions.

An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio&lt;br&gt;is considered a prognostic indicator for&lt;br&gt;patients with cancer. Neutrophils are no longer&lt;br&gt;regarded as innate immune cells with a single function,&lt;br&gt;let alone bystanders in the pathological process&lt;br&gt;of cancer. Their diversity and plasticity are&lt;br&gt;being increasingly recognized. This review&lt;br&gt;summarizes previous studies assessing the roles and&lt;br&gt;mechanisms of neutrophils in cancer initiation,&lt;br&gt;progression, metastasis and relapse. Although the findings&lt;br&gt;are controversial, the fact that neutrophils play&lt;br&gt;a dual role in promoting and suppressing cancer&lt;br&gt;is undeniable. The plasticity of neutrophils&lt;br&gt;allows..."," A simple dual-read assay for uric acid (UA) was&lt;br&gt;developed based on a combined ratiometric fluorescent&lt;br&gt;and colorimetric strategy using nitrogen-doped&lt;br&gt;carbon dots (N-CDs). The biosensor relies on the&lt;br&gt;oxidation of UA by uricase to produce H 2 O 2 , which was then&lt;br&gt;converted to \u2022 OH radicals by I -, resulting in the&lt;br&gt;oxidation of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) to&lt;br&gt;2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). In the presence of UA, the colorless&lt;br&gt;biosensor system changed to yellow. Furthermore, the&lt;br&gt;presence of DAP quenched the fluorescence emission of&lt;br&gt;the N-CDs at 427 nm based on the inner filter effect&lt;br&gt;(IFE).

Indeed, murine coronavirus (MHV) infection&lt;br&gt;provides a well-known experimental model for MS&lt;br&gt;studies. Intracerebral infection of C57BL/6 mice with&lt;br&gt;MHV-A59 revealed that viral replication was efficient&lt;br&gt;and that clearance of infectious virus occurred as&lt;br&gt;soon as 7 days post-infection. Using cDNA arrays,&lt;br&gt;analysis of gene expression profile in the brain&lt;br&gt;revealed a modulation of 80 different genes following&lt;br&gt;infection, with at least 27 of these genes having&lt;br&gt;previously been directly related to innate or acquired&lt;br&gt;immune responses.

In this study, we revealed that&lt;br&gt;cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D), a natural compound derived from&lt;br&gt;Buxus microphylla, was able to provoke mitophagy in&lt;br&gt;lung cancer cells. CVB-D-induced mitophagy&lt;br&gt;potentiates apoptosis by promoting mitochondrial&lt;br&gt;dysfunction. Mechanistically, CVB-D initiates mitophagy&lt;br&gt;by enhancing the expression of the mitophagy&lt;br&gt;receptor BNIP3 and strengthening its interaction with&lt;br&gt;LC3 to provoke mitophagy. Our results further&lt;br&gt;showed that p65, a transcriptional suppressor of&lt;br&gt;BNIP3, is downregulated upon CVB-D treatment. The&lt;br&gt;ectopic expression of p65 inhibits BNIP3 expression,&lt;br&gt;while its knockdown significantly abolishes its&lt;br&gt;transcriptional repression on BNIP3..."," Citation: Kraft, K.E.; Jaschke, A.C.;&lt;br&gt;Ravensbergen, A.-G.; Feenstra-Weelink, A.; van Goor,&lt;br&gt;M.E.L.; de Kroon, M.L.A.; Reijneveld, S.A.; Bos, A.F.;&lt;br&gt;van Dokkum, N.H.

Method: From March 23-31, 2020, we&lt;br&gt;administered an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19&lt;br&gt;perceptions, worries, and behavior changes. Participants&lt;br&gt;were a convenience sample of U.S. residents,..."," In many applications, it is necessary to&lt;br&gt;compute the timedependent distribution of an ensemble&lt;br&gt;of particles subject to transport and collision&lt;br&gt;phenomena. Kinetic equations are PDEs that model such&lt;br&gt;particles in a position-velocity phase space. In the low&lt;br&gt;collisional regime, explicit particle-based Monte Carlo&lt;br&gt;methods simulate these high dimensional equations&lt;br&gt;efficiently, but, as the collision rate increases, these&lt;br&gt;methods suffer from severe time-step constraints. In&lt;br&gt;the high collision regime,&lt;br&gt;asymptotic-preserving particle schemes are able to produce stable&lt;br&gt;results. However, this stability comes at the cost of a&lt;br&gt;bias in the computed results. In earlier work, the&lt;br&gt;multilevel Monte Carlo method..."," PURPOSE In Scotland, approximately 350&lt;br&gt;sarcoma cases are diagnosed per year and treated in one&lt;br&gt;of the five specialist centers. Many patients are&lt;br&gt;required to travel long distances to access specialist&lt;br&gt;care. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a number of rapid&lt;br&gt;changes into the care for patients with cancer, with&lt;br&gt;increasing utilization of telemedicine. We aimed to&lt;br&gt;evaluate how the utilization of telemedicine affects&lt;br&gt;professionals and patients across Scotland and care&lt;br&gt;delivery, at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre&lt;br&gt;Sarcoma Unit.\nMETHODS Between June 8 and August 25,&lt;br&gt;2020, we invited patients and professional sarcoma&lt;br&gt;multidisciplinary team members to participate in..."," The impacts on human health and the economic and&lt;br&gt;social disruption caused by the pandemic COVID-19&lt;br&gt;have been devastating. However, its environmental&lt;br&gt;consequences are poorly understood.\nThus, to assess&lt;br&gt;whether COVID-19 therapy based on the use of&lt;br&gt;azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during the&lt;br&gt;pandemic affects wild aquatic life, we exposed (for 72&lt;br&gt;hours) neotropical tadpoles of the species&lt;br&gt;Physalaemus cuvieri to the water containing these drugs to&lt;br&gt;12.5 \u00b5g/L. We observed that the increase in&lt;br&gt;superoxide dismutase and catalase in tadpoles exposed to&lt;br&gt;AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) was&lt;br&gt;predominant to keep the production of NO, ROS, TBARS..."," Astrocytes isolated from the brain of newborn&lt;br&gt;Lewis rats and an astrocytic cell line were&lt;br&gt;susceptible to infection with the neurotropic Borna&lt;br&gt;disease virus in vitro. Since astrocytes also have been&lt;br&gt;found to be infected in vivo it seemed appropriate to&lt;br&gt;test this cell type for interaction with a Borna&lt;br&gt;disease virus-specific CD 4 + T cell line. Borna disease&lt;br&gt;virus-infected astrocytes were found to be capable of&lt;br&gt;presenting virus-specific antigen to virus-specific T&lt;br&gt;cells in vitro. However, the response was&lt;br&gt;significantly enhanced if the purified 38/39 kDa Borna&lt;br&gt;disease virus-specific protein was added exogenously&lt;br&gt;to the cultures. Beside the..."," One significant component of the South African&lt;br&gt;citizenship narrative is centred around the right to basic&lt;br&gt;services and corresponding elements, including&lt;br&gt;dignity and a healthy living environment.

However, research has scarcely&lt;br&gt;considered multiple online content sources when studying&lt;br&gt;the image of destinations. This paper examines&lt;br&gt;different types of user-generated content in order to&lt;br&gt;evaluate whether and how this content reflects the&lt;br&gt;evolution of a destination's image, and its congruence&lt;br&gt;therein. The research focuses on a multi-asset tourist&lt;br&gt;destination, i.e., one which draws different market&lt;br&gt;segments. The results show a relatively high degree in&lt;br&gt;congruence and evolution of the destination's&lt;br&gt;attractions, but also questions bits of theories on&lt;br&gt;communication congruence as well as attractions' evolution&lt;br&gt;theories."," Purpose: Intern assessment during advanced&lt;br&gt;pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) are generally&lt;br&gt;based upon each individual preceptor's perceptions&lt;br&gt;without an objective measurement of intern&lt;br&gt;understanding and performance. Therefore, we sought to&lt;br&gt;determine whether a pre-and post-OSCE could be used to&lt;br&gt;confirm that interns achieved the goals and objectives&lt;br&gt;of the Ambulatory Care rotation. The aims of this&lt;br&gt;study were to determine whether a pre-rotation OSCE&lt;br&gt;can help pharmacy interns self-assess their&lt;br&gt;clinical strengths and weaknesses and assess whether&lt;br&gt;their knowledge and skills improved after&lt;br&gt;completing a post-rotation OSCE.

The sample was composed&lt;br&gt;of 315 athletes, coaches, and physical trainers&lt;br&gt;of professional soccer teams during the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic. From this amount, 214 were classified with&lt;br&gt;trait anxiety, and 315 were classified with state&lt;br&gt;anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&lt;br&gt;(STAI). This study is an epidemiological and&lt;br&gt;cross-sectional study. We applied an observational method, and&lt;br&gt;we performed a remote measurement. The&lt;br&gt;measurement was made via online questionnaires in male and&lt;br&gt;female individuals working on soccer teams (soccer&lt;br&gt;professionals or athletes) who could..."," The ORF6 protein is one of the eight accessory&lt;br&gt;proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&lt;br&gt;coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Numerous properties of ORF6 have&lt;br&gt;been documented and this study focuses on two of&lt;br&gt;these, namely, its ability to suppress the expression&lt;br&gt;of co-transfected expression constructs and its&lt;br&gt;subcellular localization to vesicular structures.&lt;br&gt;Results: Using a transient transfection system, ORF6's&lt;br&gt;ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected&lt;br&gt;expression constructs was measured in a quantitative&lt;br&gt;manner. While ORF6 does not have a global effect on&lt;br&gt;protein synthesis, quantitative real-time PCR&lt;br&gt;revealed that it down-regulated the mRNA level of the&lt;br&gt;co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Furthermore,..."," Background. Infectious diseases' outbreak&lt;br&gt;investigation requires, by definition, conducting a&lt;br&gt;thorough epidemiological assessment while&lt;br&gt;simultaneously obtaining biological samples for an adequate&lt;br&gt;screening of potential responsible pathogens. Complete&lt;br&gt;autopsies remain the gold-standard approach for&lt;br&gt;cause-of-death evaluation and characterization of emerging&lt;br&gt;diseases. However, for highly transmissible infections&lt;br&gt;with a significant associated lethality, such as&lt;br&gt;COVID-19, complete autopsies are seldom performed due to&lt;br&gt;biosafety challenges, especially in low-resource&lt;br&gt;settings. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) is a&lt;br&gt;validated new approach based on obtaining postmortem&lt;br&gt;samples from key organs and body fluids, a procedure&lt;br&gt;that does not require advanced biosafety measures&lt;br&gt;or a special autopsy..."," Results: Our search yielded 49 studies, of&lt;br&gt;which eight with a collective 127 patients (86 males&lt;br&gt;and 41 females) met our inclusion criteria.&lt;br&gt;Conservative management alone was performed in 59% of the&lt;br&gt;patients, endoscopic evaluation in 31.5%, and&lt;br&gt;interventional radiology (IR) embolization in 11%. Peptic&lt;br&gt;ulcer disease was the most common endoscopic&lt;br&gt;finding, diagnosed in 47.5% of the patients. Pooled&lt;br&gt;overall mortality was 19.1% (95% confidence interval&lt;br&gt;[CI]; 12.7%-27.6%) and pooled mortality secondary&lt;br&gt;to GIB was 3.5% (95% CI; 1.3%-9.1%).

Relative to other types of health services,&lt;br&gt;addiction treatment and overdose prevention services&lt;br&gt;are particularly vulnerable to disaster-related&lt;br&gt;disruptions for multiple reasons including fragmentation&lt;br&gt;from the general medical system and stigma, which&lt;br&gt;may lead decisionmakers and providers to&lt;br&gt;de-prioritize these services during disasters. In response&lt;br&gt;to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. states&lt;br&gt;implemented multiple policies designed to mitigate&lt;br&gt;disruptions to addiction treatment and overdose&lt;br&gt;prevention services, for example policies expanding&lt;br&gt;access to addiction treatment delivered via&lt;br&gt;telehealth and policies designed to support continuity of..."," The aim of this article is to assess the odds&lt;br&gt;ratio of hospitalization and mortality due to&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 in people with obesity using data from&lt;br&gt;residents of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil.

We used the 8-item&lt;br&gt;Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8) and the modified Medical&lt;br&gt;Research Council (mMRC) scale for somatic symptom&lt;br&gt;burden and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for&lt;br&gt;sleep quality investigation. Univariate and&lt;br&gt;multivariate analyses were performed to identify&lt;br&gt;independent factors associated with somatic symptom&lt;br&gt;burden and sleep quality.\nAlthough..."," This cross-sectional study examined the&lt;br&gt;relationship between childhood trauma, eating disorders,&lt;br&gt;and sleep quality among registered hospital&lt;br&gt;nurses in South Korea. Self-report questionnaires&lt;br&gt;were answered by 279 nurses from six general&lt;br&gt;hospitals. Factors affecting sleep quality were analyzed&lt;br&gt;with a linear regression analysis. The factors that&lt;br&gt;influenced sleep quality included age, alcohol&lt;br&gt;consumption, chronic disease, BMI, and emotional abuse in&lt;br&gt;childhood trauma. Hospital nurses need to increase their&lt;br&gt;sleep health knowledge to maintain a healthy&lt;br&gt;lifestyle while working as a nurse. Therefore, hospital&lt;br&gt;and nursing managers should consider strategies&lt;br&gt;to prevent and intervene in the sleep quality&lt;br&gt;threats attributed to..."," In this paper, we formulated a mathematical&lt;br&gt;model that studies the dynamics of HIV/ AIDS in Turkey&lt;br&gt;from 1985 to 2016. We find two equilibrium points,&lt;br&gt;disease free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium.&lt;br&gt;Global stability analysis of the equilibria was&lt;br&gt;conducted using Lyapunov function which depends on the&lt;br&gt;basic reproduction ratio R 0 . If R 0 \\ 1, the disease&lt;br&gt;free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically&lt;br&gt;stable, and if R 0 C 1 the endemic equilibrium point is&lt;br&gt;globally asymptotically stable. We computed and&lt;br&gt;predicted the basic reproduction ratios across all the&lt;br&gt;years.

Furthermore, key&lt;br&gt;issues related to these treatments (e.g., carcass and&lt;br&gt;corpse disposal events, available methods,&lt;br&gt;performances, and limitations) are addressed in conjunction&lt;br&gt;with associated environmental impacts.&lt;br&gt;Simultaneously, various treatment technologies have been&lt;br&gt;evaluated to provide insights into the adsorptive&lt;br&gt;removal of specific pollutants derived from carcass&lt;br&gt;disposal and management. In this regard, it has been&lt;br&gt;proposed that a low-cost pollutant sorbent may be&lt;br&gt;utilized, namely, biochar. Biochar has demonstrated the&lt;br&gt;ability to remove (in)organic pollutants and excess&lt;br&gt;nutrients from soils and waters; thus, we..."," In times of crisis, people are more prone to&lt;br&gt;endorse conspiracy theories. Conspiracy thinking&lt;br&gt;provides answers about the causes of an event, but it can&lt;br&gt;also have harmful social consequences. Our&lt;br&gt;research tested both the predictor and the consequences&lt;br&gt;of two types of conspiracy beliefs related to the&lt;br&gt;Covid-19 pandemic: (1) general conspiracy beliefs and&lt;br&gt;(2) government-related conspiracy theories. In&lt;br&gt;two studies in Poland (N total = 2,726), we found&lt;br&gt;that a perceived lack of individual control&lt;br&gt;predicted both types of conspiracy theories, while a&lt;br&gt;sense of collective control was positively related&lt;br&gt;to general conspiracy beliefs but negatively&lt;br&gt;associated with..."," Diagnostic investigations (pathology&lt;br&gt;laboratory and medical imaging) aim to: increase&lt;br&gt;certainty of the presence or absence of disease by&lt;br&gt;supporting the process of differential diagnosis;&lt;br&gt;support clinical management; and monitor a patient's&lt;br&gt;trajectory (e. g., disease progression or response to&lt;br&gt;treatment). Digital health can be defined as the&lt;br&gt;collection, storage, retrieval, transmission, and&lt;br&gt;utilization of data, information, and knowledge to support&lt;br&gt;healthcare. Digital health has become an essential&lt;br&gt;component of the diagnostic process, helping to&lt;br&gt;facilitate the accuracy and timeliness of information&lt;br&gt;transfer and enhance the effectiveness of&lt;br&gt;decision-making processes. Digital health is also important to&lt;br&gt;diagnostic stewardship, which involves..."," Immigrants are a special group in society, and&lt;br&gt;their health is of great concern. Few studies have&lt;br&gt;targeted this population in China. A cross-sectional&lt;br&gt;descriptive correlational study was conducted from July to&lt;br&gt;August 2018 in Hubei Province, China. Chi-square&lt;br&gt;tests, Z-tests and multivariable linear regression&lt;br&gt;analysis were performed to analyze the data using SPSS&lt;br&gt;24.0. A total of 1068 questionnaires were&lt;br&gt;distributed. The results showed that the variables that&lt;br&gt;affected the mental health of the immigrants with&lt;br&gt;chronic diseases included gender, annual income, life&lt;br&gt;events (L), negative emotion (NE), negative coping&lt;br&gt;styles (NC) and objective support (OS) (p \u2264 0.05)...."," Background: Health systems have become&lt;br&gt;financially fragile owing to the economic recession caused&lt;br&gt;by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, small primary&lt;br&gt;care businesses have received less policy&lt;br&gt;attention than public health and secondary care. We aimed&lt;br&gt;to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the number of&lt;br&gt;active small primary care businesses in South Korea."," In terms of proteomic research in the 21st&lt;br&gt;century, the realm of virology is still regarded as an&lt;br&gt;enormous challenge mainly brought by three aspects,&lt;br&gt;namely, studying on the complex proteome of the virus&lt;br&gt;with unexpected variations, developing more&lt;br&gt;accurate analytical techniques as well as&lt;br&gt;understanding viral pathogenesis and virus-host&lt;br&gt;interaction dynamics. Progresses in these areas will be&lt;br&gt;helpful to vaccine design and antiviral drugs&lt;br&gt;discovery.

The cellular antiviral protein ZAP (zinc&lt;br&gt;finger antiviral protein) binds CpGs and inhibits&lt;br&gt;HIV-1 replication when CpGs are introduced into the&lt;br&gt;viral genome. However, it is not known if&lt;br&gt;ZAP-mediated restriction is the only mechanism driving CpG&lt;br&gt;suppression. To determine how CpG dinucleotides affect&lt;br&gt;HIV-1 replication, we increased their abundance in&lt;br&gt;multiple regions of the viral genome and analyzed the&lt;br&gt;effect on RNA expression, protein abundance, and&lt;br&gt;infectious-virus production.

Here, we find that TNF\u03b1 induces significant 20&lt;br&gt;metabolic remodeling that is critical for its anti-viral&lt;br&gt;activity. Our data demonstrate that TNF\u03b1 21 activates&lt;br&gt;glycolysis through the induction of muscle-specific&lt;br&gt;hexokinase (HK2). Further, we\nshow that glycolysis is&lt;br&gt;broadly important for TNF\u03b1-mediated anti-viral&lt;br&gt;defense, as its inhibition 23 attenuates TNF\u03b1's ability&lt;br&gt;to limit the replication of evolutionarily&lt;br&gt;divergent viruses. Stable-24 isotope tracing revealed&lt;br&gt;that TNF\u03b1-mediated glycolytic activation&lt;br&gt;promotes the biosynthesis of 25 UDP-sugars (essential&lt;br&gt;precursors of protein glycosylation) and that inhibition..."," A better understanding of respiratory&lt;br&gt;syncytial virus (RSV) Background epidemiology requires&lt;br&gt;realistic estimates of RSV shedding patterns,&lt;br&gt;quantities shed, and identification of the related&lt;br&gt;underlying factors.\n: RSV infection data arise from a&lt;br&gt;cohort study of 47 households with Methods 493&lt;br&gt;occupants, in coastal Kenya, during the 2009/2010 RSV&lt;br&gt;season.

Policy makers must decide which&lt;br&gt;subgroups should be vaccinated first to minimize the&lt;br&gt;negative consequences of the pandemic. These decisions&lt;br&gt;must be made upfront and under uncertainty&lt;br&gt;regarding the amount of vaccine doses available at a given&lt;br&gt;time. The objective of the present work was to develop&lt;br&gt;an iterative optimization algorithm, which&lt;br&gt;provides a prioritization order of predefined&lt;br&gt;subgroups.

It also investigated&lt;br&gt;whether the instructors' gender and the type of&lt;br&gt;textbooks they used had a significant impact on their&lt;br&gt;responses. A survey questionnaire with 30 closed-ended&lt;br&gt;items was utilized to collect the data from 60&lt;br&gt;randomly selected EFL instructors who were teaching&lt;br&gt;English in higher education institutions and English&lt;br&gt;language centers. SPSS version 26.0 was used to analyze&lt;br&gt;the data. The findings showed that the instructors&lt;br&gt;had positive perceptions about English&lt;br&gt;textbooks. They also believed that four skills of English&lt;br&gt;were equally represented in the textbooks, and they&lt;br&gt;contained adequate..."," Receptor recognition is a major determinant of&lt;br&gt;viral host range, as well as infectivity and&lt;br&gt;pathogenesis. Emergences have been associated with&lt;br&gt;serendipitous events of adaptation upon encounters with a&lt;br&gt;novel host, and the high mutation rate of RNA viruses&lt;br&gt;has been proposed to explain their frequent host&lt;br&gt;shifts 1 . SARS-CoV-2 extensive circulation in humans&lt;br&gt;has been associated with the emergence of&lt;br&gt;variants, including variants of concern (VOCs) with&lt;br&gt;diverse mutations in the spike and increased&lt;br&gt;transmissibility or immune escape 2 .

Some authors have suggested that addressing&lt;br&gt;professional loneliness should begin in medical school. To&lt;br&gt;test this idea, we investigated how medical&lt;br&gt;students' psychological needs impact their&lt;br&gt;performance. Students' survey responses (autonomy,&lt;br&gt;competence, and relatedness needs) were linked with their&lt;br&gt;clinical decision-making scores. In regression&lt;br&gt;analysis, relatedness was determined to be the largest&lt;br&gt;and the only significant predictor of student&lt;br&gt;performance. The findings corroborate the idea of fostering&lt;br&gt;relatedness in medical training.

In&lt;br&gt;mammals, mutations in polyQ segments (and CAG repeats at&lt;br&gt;the nucleotide level) have been linked to neural&lt;br&gt;disorders and ataxias. PolyQ regions in normal human&lt;br&gt;proteins have documented functional roles, in&lt;br&gt;transcription factors and, more recently, in regulating&lt;br&gt;autophagy. Despite the high frequency of polyQ repeats in&lt;br&gt;eukaryotic genomes, little attention has been given to the&lt;br&gt;presence or possible role of polyQ sequences in virus&lt;br&gt;genomes.

However, the mechanism underlying the&lt;br&gt;RES-mediated protection against myocardial infarction has&lt;br&gt;not yet been revealed entirely. In this study, we&lt;br&gt;investigated the protective effects of RES on cardiac&lt;br&gt;function in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction&lt;br&gt;(AMI) and the related underlying mechanisms.&lt;br&gt;Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly&lt;br&gt;divided into four groups: Sham (sham operation),&lt;br&gt;Sham-RES, AMI (AMI induction), and AMI-RES.

Many drugs&lt;br&gt;without established efficacy are being used to treat&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate&lt;br&gt;use or as a clinical trial. Although drug&lt;br&gt;repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and&lt;br&gt;cost, there is a need to make predictions on success&lt;br&gt;before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of&lt;br&gt;these repurposed drugs, many factors should be&lt;br&gt;considered such as drug-gene or dug-drug interactions,&lt;br&gt;drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity.

In this paper,&lt;br&gt;we construct a signature scheme by exploring a new&lt;br&gt;approach to the area. To do this, we design a&lt;br&gt;zero-knowledge identification scheme, which we then render&lt;br&gt;static via standard means (e.g. Fiat-Shamir). We show&lt;br&gt;that practical instances of our protocol have the&lt;br&gt;potential to outperform the state of the art on code-based&lt;br&gt;signatures, achieving small data sizes with a low&lt;br&gt;computational complexity."," Protection of public health against&lt;br&gt;pathogenic viruses transmitted through the airborne&lt;br&gt;route requires effective sampling of airborne&lt;br&gt;viruses for determination of their concentration and&lt;br&gt;distribution. However, sampling viable airborne viruses is&lt;br&gt;challenging as conventional bioaerosol sampling devices&lt;br&gt;operate on inertia-based mechanisms that inherently&lt;br&gt;have low sampling efficiency for virus aerosols in&lt;br&gt;the ultrafine size range (&lt; 100 nm). Herein, a Batch&lt;br&gt;Adiabatic-expansion for Size Intensification by Condensation&lt;br&gt;(BASIC) approach was developed for efficient sampling&lt;br&gt;of virus aerosols.
